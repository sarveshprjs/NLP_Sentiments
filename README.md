# NLP_Sentiments
# Natural Language Processing Projects

This repository contains a collection of NLP projects focused on understanding and processing human language using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

The goal of this project collection is to explore core NLP tasks such as:
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Topic modeling
- Language modeling and text generation
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
- Transformers and BERT-based models

Each project is built with a focus on practical implementation, clean code structure, and reproducibility.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Gensim
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (optional, based on model)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-projects.git
